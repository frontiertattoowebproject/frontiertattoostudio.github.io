              <h1 style="position:relative;top:60px;">Cancellation Policy</h1>
              <p style="position:relative;top:40px;"> We understand that sometimes unexpected delays can occur, making schedule adjustments. If you need to cancel your appointment, we respectfully request at least a 24 hour notice.</p>
              <h1 style="position:relative;top:60px;">Our Policy</h1>
              <p style="position:relative;top:40px;">Any tattoo cancellation made less than 48 hours from the start of your appointment time will result in the cancellation fee agreed to at the time of booking. Any piercing cancellation made less than 24 hours from the start of your appointment time will result in the cancellation fee agreed to at the time of booking.
                  If you are more than 15 minutes late for your service or do not have proper documentation, we will not be able to accommodate you. This will result in the cancellation fee agreed to at the time of booking.
                  Cancellation fees equates the deposit you paid to book said appointment.</p>
                  <h1 style="position:relative;top:60px;">No Call, No Show Policy</h1>
                  <p style="position:relative;top:40px;">Any cancellation made less than 24 hours from the start of your appointment time will result in the cancellation fee agreed to at the time of booking.
                      When you book your appointment, you are holding a space on our calendar that is no longer available to our other clients. Because our studio is by appointment only at this time it is important to notify us if you will not be able to make it in. Clients that no call, no show to their appointment will be charged their full piercing service fee that was deposited when booking.</p>
                      <h1 style="position:relative;top:60px;">Sales & Service</h1>
                      <p style="position:relative;top:40px;">All sales are final. No returns or exchanges. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone at anytime.</p>
                      <h1 style="position:relative;top:60px;">Touch Up Policy</h1>
                      <p style="position:relative;top:40px;">Touch-ups are free if booked within the first 3 months, and not from self infliction. Except for feet, hands, and neck. They would be subject to a touch-up fee of 30$ as they naturally wear more, so just the cost of equipment (the 3 months free does not apply). After 3 months, touch-ups are the regular tattooing rate, unless booked in for another tattoo with the same artist, it can be touched up for free during that session in the first year.</p><br><br><br>
